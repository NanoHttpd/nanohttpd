## What is "nanohttpd"?

*NanoHttpd* is a light-weight HTTP server designed for embedding in other applications.

*NanoHttpd* has been released under a Modified BSD licence.

## Current major development efforts

Please take a look at the new "ssl-support" branch containing submitted code adding SSL 
support to NanoHttpd.  It's a great new feature that needs all eyes to polish in preparation
for a release, making sure it works on all platforms.

## Core Features
* Only one Java file, providing HTTP 1.1 support.
* 2 "flavors" - one at "current" standards and one strictly Java 1.1 compatible.
* Released as open source, free software, under a Modified BSD licence.
* No fixed config files, logging, authorization etc. (Implement by yourself if you need them.)
* Experimental support for SSL (see the 'ssl-support' branch in git)
* Basic support for cookies
* Supports parameter parsing of GET and POST methods.
* Rudimentary PUT support (added in 1.25).
* Support for HEAD and DELETE requests.
* Supports single and multi-value parameters (w/ a helper method) if needed.
* Supports file upload (since version 1.2, 2010) with minimal memory overhead.
* Never caches anything.
* Doesn't limit bandwidth, request time or simultaneous connections.
* All header names are converted lowercase so they don't vary between browsers/clients.
* Very low memory overhead when processing even the largest of requests.
* Temp file usage and threading model are easily cutomized.
* Persistent connections (Connection "keep-alive") support allowing multiple requests to be served over a single socket connection.

## Webserver Features
* Supports both dynamic content and file serving.
* Default code serves files and shows all HTTP parameters and headers.
* File server supports directory listing, ```index.html``` and ```index.htm```.
* File server supports partial content (streaming).
* File server supports ETags.
* File server does the 301 redirection trick for directories without ```/```.
* File server supports simple skipping for files (continue download).
* File server serves also very long files without memory overhead.
* Contains a built-in list of most common mime types.

## How is the project managed?

The project is managed with a "fork and pull-request" pattern.

If you want to contribute, fork this repo and submit a pull-request of your changes when you're ready.

Anyone can create Issues, and pull requests should be tied back to an issue describing the purpose of the submitted code.

## The Tests

In an ideal world for a bug fix: write a test of your own that fails as a result of the bug being present.  Then fix the bug so that your unit-test passes.  The test will now be a guard against the bug ever coming back.

Similarly for enhancements, exercise your code with tests.

Whatever else happens, if you make changes to the code, the unit & integration test suite (under ```core/src/main/test/```) should all continue to function.  Pull requests with broken tests will be rejected.

## Where can I find the original (Java1.1) NanoHttpd?

The original (Java 1.1 project) and the Java 6 project merged in early 2013 to pool resources
around "NanoHttpd" as a whole, regardless of flavor.  Development of the Java 1.1 version continues
as a permanent branch ("nanohttpd-for-java1.1") in the main http://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd repository.

## How do I use nanohttpd?

Firstly take a look at the "samples" sub-module.  The sample code illustrates using NanoHttpd in various ways.

Secondly, you can run the standalone *NanoHttpd Webserver*.

Or, create your own class that extends `NanoHTTPD` and overrides one of the two flavors of the `serve()` method.  For example:

```java
public class DebugServer extends NanoHTTPD {
    /**
     * Constructs an HTTP server on given port.
     */
    public DebugServer() {
        super(8080);
    }

    @Override
    public Response serve(String uri, Method method, Map<String, String> header, Map<String, String> parms, Map<String, String> files) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("<html>");
        sb.append("<head><title>Debug Server</title></head>");
        sb.append("<body>");
        sb.append("<h1>Response</h1>");
        sb.append("<p><blockquote><b>URI -</b> ").append(uri).append("<br />");
        sb.append("<b>Method -</b> ").append(method).append("</blockquote></p>");
        sb.append("<h3>Headers</h3><p><blockquote>").append(header).append("</blockquote></p>");
        sb.append("<h3>Parms</h3><p><blockquote>").append(parms).append("</blockquote></p>");
        sb.append("<h3>Files</h3><p><blockquote>").append(files).append("</blockquote></p>");
        sb.append("</body>");
        sb.append("</html>");
        return new Response(sb.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ServerRunner.run(DebugServer.class);
    }
}
```

## Why fork the original repo?

The Java 6 version of *nanohttpd* was born when we realized that embedding Jetty inside our
Android application was going to inflate the size without bringing along features that we
were going to need.  The search for a smaller more streamlined HTTP server lead us
to *nanohttpd* as the project had started with exactly the same goals, but we wanted to
clear up the old code - move from Java 1.1, run _static code analysis_ tools and cleanup
the findings and pull out sample/test code from the source.

In the words of the original founder of the project
> I couldn't find a small enough, embeddable and easily modifiable HTTP server
> that I could just copy and paste into my other Java projects. Every one of them
> consisted of dozens of .java files and/or jars, usually with - from my point
> of view - "overkill features" like servlet support, web administration,
> configuration files, logging etc.

Since that time we fixed a number of bugs, moved the build to _maven_ and pulled out
the samples from the runtime JAR to further slim it down.

The two projects pooled resources in early 2013, merging code-bases, to better support the
user base and reduce confusion over why _two_ NanoHttpd projects existed.
